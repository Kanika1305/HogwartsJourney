      <h2>Story Summary</h2>
      <p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. The story follows Harry, Hermione, and Ron as they set out on a dangerous mission to destroy the Horcruxes, objects containing pieces of Voldemort’s soul. With Voldemort gaining control of the Ministry of Magic, the trio must remain in hiding, using their resourcefulness and bravery to uncover the secrets of the Deathly Hallows, three powerful magical artifacts that could help in their fight.

        As they search for the Horcruxes, they encounter numerous obstacles, including betrayal, loss, and the threat of death. The trio’s journey leads them to Hogwarts, where the final battle between the forces of good and evil unfolds.

        In the end, Voldemort is defeated, and peace is restored to the wizarding world. The book explores themes of friendship, loyalty, love, and the triumph of good over evil. Deathly Hallows concludes the saga of Harry Potter with emotional depth, action, and resolution, bringing the story to a satisfying and epic conclusion.</p>
