      <h2>Story Summary</h2>
      <p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (also known as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) follows the journey of an orphaned boy, Harry Potter, who discovers on his 11th birthday that he is a wizard. Raised by his cruel aunt and uncle, Harry learns he is famous in the wizarding world for surviving an attack by the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, when he was just a baby. Voldemort's curse failed, leaving Harry with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead and causing Voldemortâ€™s downfall.

        Harry is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Throughout the school year, the trio uncovers the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone, a magical object that grants immortality. They learn that the stone is hidden within the school, and that someone is trying to steal it to restore Voldemort to power.
        
        In the climax, Harry faces Professor Quirrell, who is secretly working for Voldemort. With the help of his friends and the protective magic left by his parents' love, Harry prevents Voldemort from obtaining the Stone. The school year ends with Harry returning to his aunt and uncle's house, eager to return to Hogwarts for his second year.</p>
