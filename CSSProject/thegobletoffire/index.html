      <h2>Story Summary</h2>
      <p>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire follows Harry Potter during his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year, Hogwarts is hosting the prestigious Triwizard Tournament, where champions from three wizarding schools—Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang—compete in a series of magical challenges. The Goblet of Fire, a magical object, selects the champions. However, despite being underage and not entering himself, Harry is mysteriously chosen as the fourth champion, alongside Hogwarts’ official champion, Cedric Diggory.

        Throughout the tournament, Harry faces dangerous tasks, including battling a dragon, rescuing friends from an enchanted lake, and navigating a treacherous maze. While dealing with these physical challenges, Harry must also contend with strained friendships, particularly with Ron, who initially resents Harry's unexpected selection.
        
        As the tournament progresses, Harry uncovers darker secrets. In the final task, Harry and Cedric are transported to a graveyard where Lord Voldemort and his followers await. Voldemort regains his physical form and power, marking his full return. In a harrowing duel, Harry narrowly escapes with Cedric's body, shaken by the death of his friend and the reality of Voldemort’s revival.</p>
