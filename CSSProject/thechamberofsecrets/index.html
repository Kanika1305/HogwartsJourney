      <h2>Story Summary</h2>
      <p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets follows Harry’s second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After receiving a warning from Dobby, a house-elf, Harry returns to school despite the elf’s efforts to prevent him. At Hogwarts, strange things begin to happen: students and a cat are mysteriously petrified, and rumors swirl about the legendary Chamber of Secrets, said to house a monster capable of purging the school of Muggle-born students.

        With the help of his friends Ron and Hermione, Harry investigates the chamber's history and discovers that it was built by Salazar Slytherin, one of the school’s founders, who believed in pure-blood wizardry. The attacks intensify, and suspicion falls on Harry as he hears strange voices in the walls of the school. As the mystery unfolds, Harry learns that the monster is a giant serpent, and the chamber is hidden beneath Hogwarts itself.
        
        In the climax, Harry confronts the heir of Slytherin, Tom Riddle, who reveals himself to be a young Lord Voldemort. Harry defeats the basilisk, saves Ginny Weasley, and destroys a diary that held a part of Voldemort’s soul. With the chamber sealed and the students safe, Harry and his friends are hailed as heroes.
